## TODO:

- Please *copy* the project into your own github account and work on it there.
- Please *do not* fork the project, or make PRs to this repo.
- Create a backend API call to get the weather forecast for a given latitude and longitude. See `weather.service.ts`.
- Update the frontend to use the new API call and display the weather forecast (temperature, wind speed, etc.) for a selected location. Search for `TODO` in the code.
- The location can be chosen either by searching for a city name, or by clicking on the map.
- Please make sure you check for errors and display them to the user. Also make sure you handle the loading state.
